<h2> Lore </h2>

Kelpier Velmont was the very first station built within the Letum Sector, serving as the initial hub for housing, research and combat deployment.

Due to resources and manpower constraints, engineering teams had to disregard layouts designs due to increasing threats from Xenos from neighboring asteroids and planets. Initial deployments of engineer teams yielded 80% loses during the construction of the station.


## Station Info


Built on April 9th, 2215
***Engineering Teams***
- Velmont 1 - Foxren Company
- Kelpier 2 - Foxren Company
- Talon 5 - Juno Company
- Polar 7 - Xenocrom Company
- Zetra 3 - Xenocrom Company


#### *Arrival Bays*

The station features two arrival bays with cargo mixed into both bays due to space constraints

- Small to Medium Size shuttles can land
- Cargo network linked between the two bays
- Multiple Cargo shuttles can come to either bay

#### *Engineering*

The station runs on two turbines though have a 32% failure rate due to high stress use
Engineers on this station are expected to help with combat defenses in the event of a station invasion

- One turbine can power the whole station while the other is in maintenance 
- Halon Fire suppression system
- R&D likes to play around and use one of the turbines for experiments with gas ratios
- Engineering department is the 3rd most biggest wing

#### *Atmospherics*

Due to initial resource constraints during construction, Atmospherics relied on Cargo and logistics ships for canisters of Oxygen and Nitrogen. 

- Atmospherics has a canister holding area
- A recycler system was built later on though has a failure rate of 10%
- 10 canisters can be deployed at any one time (5 Oxygen/5 Nitrogen)
- Interconnected with Engineering

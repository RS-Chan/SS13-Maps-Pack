<h2> Lore </h2>

Kelpier Velmont was the very first station built within the Letum Sector, serving as the initial hub for housing, research and combat deployment.

Due to resources and manpower constraints, engineering teams had to disregard layouts designs due to increasing threats from Xenos from neighboring asteroids and planets. Initial deployments of engineer teams yielded 80% loses during the construction of the station.


## Station Info


**Built on April 9th, 2215**
 
***Engineering Teams***
- Velmont 1 - Foxren Company
- Kelpier 2 - Foxren Company
- Talon 5 - Juno Company
- Polar 7 - Xenocrom Company
- Zetra 3 - Xenocrom Company


#### *Arrival Bays*

The station features two arrival bays with cargo mixed into both bays due to space constraints

- Small to Medium Size shuttles can land
- Cargo network linked between the two bays
- Multiple Cargo shuttles can come to either bay

#### *Engineering*

The station runs on two turbines though have a 32% failure rate due to high stress use
Engineers on this station are expected to help with combat defenses in the event of a station invasion

- One turbine can power the whole station while the other is in maintenance 
- Halon Fire suppression system
- R&D likes to play around and use one of the turbines for experiments with gas ratios
- Engineering department is the 3rd most biggest wing

#### *Atmospherics*

Due to initial resource constraints during construction, Atmospherics relied on Cargo and logistics ships for canisters of Oxygen and Nitrogen. 

- Atmospherics has a canister holding area
- A recycler system was built later on though has a failure rate of 10%
- 10 canisters can be deployed at any one time (5 Oxygen/5 Nitrogen)
- Interconnected with Engineering

#### *Living Quarters*

The Living Quarters is one of the stations main features, from lavish rooms for officers to very tight, ~~inhuman~~, bunk spaces for soldiers. 
The rough estimated amount is about 2 Companies or 400 people at one time. Can hold at max, 3 to 4 Companies if necessary. (US Army Reference)

- Features officer spaces separate from the crew
- Gym, Holodeck, and much more
- Yes, you can have a ~~orgy party~~ frat party like in college
- Largest wing of the station

#### *Security/Brig*

The Security wing is north fo the Living Quarters and south of the Command wing for rapid peacekeeping/neutralizing any onboard threats.
The brig can roughly hold around 40 people with 4 people per cell.

- Security Teams are equipped when coming onto station per orders
- There is a mini Armoury in case of riots
- The Armoury above R&D can only be opened remotely by Command
- 2 Squads are deemed as sufficient in regards to the whole station (I mean, you are on a Private Military Station, everyone is at least a soldier....)

#### *Armoury*

The Armoury resides in the northern section of the station, right next to R&D and outside of the Command Wing. 
There is enough guns in the event that there is a attack on the station that everyone can defend.

- Remotely controlled from Bridge
- Enough guns and ammo to fund a war
- Triple locked access doors (Security)
- ***In the event of a station invasion, Armoury is considered a high priority defense area as per Command orders***
- > "Order D5A-311, Under no circumstances shall Armoury fall under enemy hands, human or xeno, and is considered a high priority defense target"
